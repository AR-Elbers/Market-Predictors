The name of the riot comes from one of the first destinations the mob attacked, the restaurant owned by a free black man, Beverly Snow's Epicurean Eating House. After attacking the restaurant, the mob destroyed the school Arthur Bowen went to, because he was suspected of being taught the abolition of slavery there. The larger context of the attack on the school was the white working-class men's frustration over free blacks' ability to work, and their resentment of black competition for jobs. The clear result was the unleashing of white terror against blacks. The riot began on 12 August 1835 and continued for days in the nation's capital, and it was not until President Andrew Jackson intervened that it stopped.[2]",Washington,D.C.,"Washington, D.C.",38.8899389,-77.0090505,Racial Attack,8/12/1835,August,8,12,1835,Wednesday

Battle of Virden,"The Battle of Virden, also known as the Virden Massacre, was a labor union conflict in central Illinois that occurred on October 12, 1898. After a United Mine Workers of America local struck a mine in Virden, the Chicago-Virden Coal Company hired armed detectives or security guards to accompany African-American strikebreakers to start production again. An armed conflict broke out when the train carrying these men arrived at Virden. The detectives shot first but strikers were also armed: a total of four detective/security guards and seven striking mine workers were killed, with five guards and more than thirty miners wounded.",Virden,Illinois,"Virden, Illinois",39.5008866,-89.7678746,Labor Strike,10/12/1898,October,10,12,1898,Wednesday
Wilmington Insurrection,"The Wilmington insurrection of 1898, also known as the Wilmington massacre of 1898 or the Wilmington coup of 1898,[6] occurred in Wilmington, North Carolina, on Thursday, November 10, 1898.[7] It is considered a turning point in post-Reconstruction North Carolina politics. The event initiated an era of more severe racial segregation and effective disenfranchisement of African Americans throughout the South, a shift already underway since passage by Mississippi of a new constitution in 1890, raising barriers to voter registration. Laura Edwards wrote in Democracy Betrayed (2000): ""What happened in Wilmington became an affirmation of white supremacy not just in that one city, but in the South and in the nation as a whole"", as it affirmed that invoking ""whiteness"" eclipsed the legal citizenship, individual rights, and equal protection under the law that blacks were guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment.",Wilmington,North Carolina,"Wilmington, North Carolina",34.2181612,-77.8302149,Racial Attack,11/10/1898,November,11,10,1898,Thursday
Coeur d'Alene Labor Riot,"The Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, labor riot of 1899 was the second of two major labor-management confrontations in the Coeur d'Alene mining district of northern Idaho in the 1890s. Like the first incident seven years earlier, the 1899 confrontation was an attempt by union miners, led by the Western Federation of Miners to unionize non-union mines, and have them pay the higher union wage scale. As with the 1892 strike, the 1899 incident culminated in a dynamite attack that destroyed a non-union mining facility, the burning of multiple homes and outbuildings and two murders, followed by military occupation of the district.",Coeur d'Alene,Idaho,"Coeur d'Alene, Idaho",47.6734632,-116.7812225,Labor Strike,7/1/1899,July,7,1,1899,Saturday
