The famous French Quarter and Garden District escaped flooding because those areas are above sea level. The major breaches included the 17th Street Canal levee, the Industrial Canal levee, and the London Avenue Canal floodwall. These breaches caused the majority of the flooding, according to a June 2007 report by the American Society of Civil Engineers.[4] The flood disaster halted oil production and refining which increased oil prices worldwide.",New Orleans,Louisiana,"New Orleans, Louisiana",29.961054,-90.0347944,Natural Disaster,8/29/2005,August,8,29,2005,Monday
