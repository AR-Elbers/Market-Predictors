The city closed saloons and theaters to discourage assemblies.

When the violence ended, 15 people had died: at least 10 white people, including two police officers[5]; and around 5 black people. Fifty people were seriously wounded and another 100 less severely wounded.

Beginning the night of November 8th, a mob gathered at a local boarding house owned by an interracial couple, demanding all Filipino boarders leave town.
