The famous French Quarter and Garden District escaped flooding because those areas are above sea level. The major breaches included the 17th Street Canal levee, the Industrial Canal levee, and the London Avenue Canal floodwall. These breaches caused the majority of the flooding, according to a June 2007 report by the American Society of Civil Engineers.[4] The flood disaster halted oil production and refining which increased oil prices worldwide.",New Orleans,Louisiana,"New Orleans, Louisiana",29.961054,-90.0347944,Natural Disaster,8/29/2005,August,8,29,2005,Monday

Police Shooting of George Floyd,"2020 – The Minneapolis Uprising and George Floyd protests began on May 26 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police. Derek Chauvin, the then policeman who held his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes, was fired along with the three other officers involved. Chauvin was charged with manslaughter and second-degree murder. The other three policemen were charged with aiding and abetting murder. Protests spread to other American cities and then to other countries with Floyd's murder garnering international condemnation.[8] Protest tactics included peaceful occupation and resistance, defensive action and barricading following violent escalation by the police and state agencies, and looting and arson of corporate commercial property. In the Seattle neighborhood of Capitol Hill, an occupation protest and self-declared autonomous zone was established on June 8, 2020 covering six city blocks and a park after the Seattle Police Department left their East Precinct building.
